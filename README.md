# BI-in-practice

## Scope
This project is intended to be filled with practical knowledge on all matters related to Qlik (`Qlik Sense Cloud`, `Qlik Sense Enterprise (On Premise)`, `Qlik Sense Desktop`, `Qlikview`). That includes theory on BI related topics such as data modeling, ETL practices, commenting and structuring code etc.

## Structure
The files are structured according to if the information applies to a specific instance of Qlik or if it is generally applicable. A file generally contains practical information on how to do something specific, but also give tips on things to keep in mind or topics related to the file. Files are coded in markdown (.md) to give the text structure and increase readability.
