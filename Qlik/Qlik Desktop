# Add extensions to Qlik Desktop

## Use Case
Extensions are used to enhance the capabilites of Qlik. When implementing an extension it is important to think about different consequences of using extensions in production.

- An extension might incur a cost to use, either one time off or subscription based
- Extensions might not be supported and might break when Qlik is updated
- The user might get used to having the functionality of the extension and if it breaks might cause big problems in the production environment

Despite these consequences there are extensions that during development, and troubleshooting, will benefit the development process. One such extension is [Quick Table Viewer](https://github.com/ChristofSchwarz/qsQuickTableViewer).

Quick table viewer is used to quickly create a table with all the fields in said table.
