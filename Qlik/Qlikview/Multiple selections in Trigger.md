# Multiple selections in Trigger

## Use Case

Triggers are used to automatically trigger (for example) a selection when a user changes tabs or opens a document. If you want "hard code" two or more specific values you do the following:

## Code

```
//Select two strings:
='(StringOne|StringTwo)'

//Can use Wildcard characters:
='(StringOne|*MiddleOfWord*)'

```
